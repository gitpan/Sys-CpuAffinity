Sys-CpuAffinity v0.94
=====================

The Sys::CpuAffinity module seeks to "do one thing and do it well":
set CPU affinities for processes on any system that can use Perl
and by any means necessary.

The module is composed of several subroutines, each one 
implementing a different technique to perform a CPU affinity
operation. A technique might try to import a Perl module,
run an external program that might be installed on your system,
or invoke some C code to access your system libraries.
Usually, a technique is applicable to only a single
or small group of operating systems, and on any particular 
system, the vast majority of techniques would fail. 
Regardless of your particular system and configuration,
it is hoped that at least one of the techniques will work
and you will be able to get and set the CPU affinities of
your processes.

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS

The techniques for manipulating CPU affinities for Windows
(including Cygwin) and Linux have been refined and tested
pretty well. Some techniques applicable to BSD systems
(particularly FreeBSD) have been tested a little bit. The
hope is that this module will include more techniques for
more systems in future releases. See the NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
in the module's perldoc for information about how you
can help.

RECOMMENDED MODULES

The following modules are not required by Sys::CpuAffinity,
but Sys::CpuAffinity will try to use them if they are 
available.

        Win32::API, Win32::Process [MSWin32, cygwin]
        BSD::Process::Affinity [*bsd]
        Solaris::Lgrp [solaris]
