XS files for Sys::CpuAffinity module.

During build, these *.xs files are copied
to the ./lib directory structure, where
ExtUtils::CBuilder will attempt to compile them.

Any units that fail to compile will be
removed from the ./lib directory tree.

The remaining units that successfully compiled
will be removed and combined into a single
lib/Sys/CpuAffinity.xs file.




bsd-getaffinity_processor_bind.xs:

	Function to get affinity on BSD systems.

cpuset_getaffinity.xs

	BSD(?) function to get affinity.

linux-sched_get_affinity.xs

	Linux function to get affinity. Requires the
	<sched.h> and <linux/unistd.h> headers.

linux-sched_set_affinity.xs

	Linux function to set affinity. Requires the
	<sched.h> and <linux/unistd.h> headers

win32_system_info.xs

	Functions to retrieve system info (including
	the number of processors) on Windows systems
	(including Cygwin). Uses the <w32api/windows.h>
	and <w32api/winbase.h> headers.

win32_system_info_alt.xs

	Identical functionality to  win32_system_info.xs  
	but looks for the <windows.h> and <winbase.h> 
	headers. Uses alternate function names in case
	both win32_system_info files successfully compile.


fortytwo.xs
hello.xs

	Sample XS files that should compile on
	any system (or at least any system with
	a compiler). Even if nothing else compiles,
	this will give you a CpuAffinity.xs file and
	demonstrate that XS is available on your
	system.
